<Section title="FarEast CTF" description="Project" header>
In preparation for another Capture The Flag championship,
our team needed an official website.
It was required by the sponsors,
who demanded a representative site
so that the participants could see the logos of the companies.
I needed to please both the sponsors and my teammates,
since I did the design and website alone.

**Team**: FarEastCTF

**Role**: full-stack developer, designer

**Year**: 2021

This time there were supposed to be foreign teams in the championship,
so the official website had to support switching the language from
English to Russian and vice versa.

The project was created based on the following development stack:
**_Next.js, framer-motion, emotion, rosetta, Express, NeDB, TypeScript_**.
