<Section title="FarEast CTF" description="Project" >
In preparation for another Capture The Flag championship,
our team needed an official website.
It was required by the sponsors,
who demanded a representative site
so that the participants could see the logos of the companies.
I needed to please both the sponsors and my teammates,
since I did the design and website alone.
